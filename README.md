# Hello!

Hey! I am Sonosus. I'm an engineering student, electronics hobbyist, and maker of random useless things.

This account holds most of my ventures into DIY synths and electronics. I am building a Kosmo format(20cm) modular system, popularised by Sam Battle/Look Mum No Computer.

I am a big fan of open source, and try and share as much as possible about my designs. If there's something missing or you have any questions, I am happy to help. Please see the contact section below.

Occasionally if I have spare PCBs to offload I will sell them on my [Tindie](https://tindie.com/stores/sonosus) store.


# Contact

You can email me directly (sonosusoshwa at gmail dot com).

Alternatively you can send me a PM on the LMNC Discourse forum - https://lookmumnocomputer.discourse.group/u/sonosus


# List of repositories

I did have a big list of all my finished/unfinished projects here but ended up removing it because it quickly became a burden to maintain. Let me know if there's anything you're not sure about and be warned that not everything you find on here has been fully tested.

# Support
I've had a couple of requests from folks who want to financially support my work. I build synths and electronics in my spare time, and will always make my work open source for the world to enjoy - I publish my designs here because I want to give back to the DIY community and benefit as many people as possible. 
I don't want to advertise this widely, but since some people have asked for it, you can now tip me on [Ko-fi](ko-fi.com/sonosus). This is absolutely at your discretion - don't feel you have to, but if you do decide to donate, it is much appreciated.
